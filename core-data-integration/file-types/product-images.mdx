### Processing Images

The list of images for a product in a given file is considered canonical. This means that every time an import file is processed, when the first instance of a given product reference is encountered, all the existing images associated with that product will be removed.

This provides a deterministic way to express what images should be associated with a product and its variants.

### Example

A new product is added to the catalog. There is only one image available. The following file assigns it to the product, but no specific variants.

```
product_ref,skus,image_url,position
300,,https://bspk.com/image1.jpg,1
```

A photoshoot took place and now there are more specific pictures available for each sku. The following file assigns them to each variants.

```
product_ref,skus,image_url,position
300,,https://bspk.com/image-var1.1.jpg,1
300,VAR1,https://bspk.com/image-var1.2.jpg,2
300,VAR2,https://bspk.com/image-var2.1.jpg,3
300,VAR3;VAR4,https://bspk.com/image-var2.1.jpg,4
```

After this file is processed, the previously imported `image1.jpg` is no longer associated with the product.

<Info>`image_url` are cached. If a same url is encountered, the content will not be downloaded again. If you change an image, make sure the file name is different.</Info>
