### Standard price

A standard price will be applied as soon as it is received, considering there is no `starting_on` date or a date in the past. It has `discounted` as FALSE. If a new standard price is received, it will immediately replace the current standard price.

### Scheduling a standard price

There is the possibility of setting a price to be applied on a future date. For example, in order to schedule standard price from the specified date 20XX-12-24, the CSV row with such standard price needs to be set as `starting_on: "20XX-12-24"`. This price will be applied automatically at 20XX-12-24 and will remain applied until a new standard price is imported.

### Discounted price

A discounted price is different in a way that the price will appear differently in BSPK, showing the standard and discounted price together, making the discount evident in the product page. In order to import a discounted price, the `discounted` attribute needs to be set to TRUE.

For a discounted price to be applied, a standard price must also or already be set for a given product. Just like the standard price, the discount price can also be specified for particular currency code, SKU or store of given product.

Both standard and discounted price can be sent in the same import file. In order to reset the discounted price, a new standard price needs to be imported for that product. Current discounted price can also be overwritten with a new discounted price whenever a new discounted price is imported.

### Scheduling a discounted price

There is the possibility of scheduling a discounted price for the future. There is also the possibility of setting an `ending_on` date for that discounted price. If no end date is set, the discounted price will remain until a new price is applied.

As an example, lets suppose there is a sale for the upcoming holiday, that will start on Dec 24 and end on Jan 02. A price is sent with `discounted` TRUE, `starting_on` Dec 24 and `ending_on` Jan 02. This way, once Dec 24 starts, the discounted price will be applied, and once Jan 03 hits, the price is reverted back to its standard one.
