To fully experience the advantages of using a SaaS platform like BSPK, the traditional approach of dedicated hosting for individual brands is no longer sufficient due to its resource limitations and associated high costs. BSPK operates as a cloud platform, and while it is technically possible to host BSPK as a dedicated hosting, we don't recommend it to our customers. The BSPK cloud service is optimized for efficiency and security, which is why we host the platform in the cloud in Europe on AWS and Heroku Salesforce. BSPK functions as a multi-tenant platform, efficiently accommodating data from multiple brands. The cloud-based infrastructure ensures data safety and aligns with GDPR privacy requiremetns and standards.
