At BSPK, we've always prioritized our security approach. This involves using advanced encryption methods, staying up-to-date with the latest industry standards, and partnering with carefully chosen secure service providers. These technical measures work together to create a strong defense against potential threats to protect your data and ensure we meet your compliance requirements.

### üîí Two Way Encryption 

When data is transmitted between the BSPK platform via RESTful APIs, it is encrypted to prevent interception by malicious actors. This end-to-end encryption guarantees that the data remains secure and intact during transit, keeping the confidentiality and integrity of the information being exchanged.

### üè¢ Secure Service Providers 

To fortify the security of BSPK infrastructure, we have partnered with renowned, globally recognized secure service providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Salesforce-owned Heroku, which offers state-of-the-art security measures, robust infrastructure, and compliance certifications.

### üîê Two Factor Authentication 

We ensure accessing our BSPK systems is extra secure using a two-factor authentication (2FA) method. This means users need to provide two types of proof to get in. Along with the usual password, they also need to give a second piece of info, a code from the authenticator app. This adds a strong layer of security. Even if a password gets stolen, 2FA stops unauthorized access.

### ‚úÖ Security Audit 

As part of BSPK's commitment to robust security practices, we've conducted a comprehensive security audit by KPMG, a reputable security auditing firm, specifically for one of our client solutions. Any security concerns that emerged during the audit were carefully addressed and resolved to ensure alignment with industry standards.

### üîè GDPR Compliant 

Being GDPR compliant means BSPK adheres to the General Data Protection Regulation, a set of data protection rules in the European Union. This compliance signifies our commitment to safeguarding the privacy and rights of individuals whose data we handle.
