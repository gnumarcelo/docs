Special order events represent the various states the order goes through before it's finalized. They are mostly provided as historical view, but in some cases can trigger an alert for user intervention.

      <td>Determine if this event requires human intervention. The sales associate for this order will be alerted.</td>
      <td>TRUE</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Notes

The `action_required` field will only trigger a visible action if this is set to TRUE for the last event in the sequence.

For example:

| Sequence | Description | action_required | Application Behavior |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 3 | Sent to boutique | FALSE | Nothing |
| 4 | Received at boutique | TRUE | This event and the special order will be surfaced to the sales associate to take next steps |
| 5 | Delivered to client | FALSE | This event will cause any notification or alerts to be removed for the sales associate |

### Event Processing Rules

Special order events are append-only data. Previously sent events can't be updated or deleted. If an event for an order has already been imported, future events with the same `sequence` and `order_ref` will be ignored.
