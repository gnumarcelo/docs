title: S3 Buckets & Keys Management Guide
---

## Introduction 

Batch file import into BSPK are performed via AWS S3 buckets. Your company has its own dedicated S3 bucket provisioned by BSPK. S3 access keys (S3 keys) give you the ability to programmatically upload files to your company S3 bucket and automate any part of your workflow with the BSPK import.

You can get more details on the import process in [Core Data Integration Guide](/core-data-integration/introduction)

## Managing S3 keys 

To be able to work with S3 buckets directly, you need to create an S3 key.

To do this, please go to the corresponding section in your company’s Admin portal. Select the **S3 Keys** link in the **Manage** section.

A list of all your S3 keys will be displayed. Take a note your company S3 bucket name. You will need it later.

<Info>
Please note that you can only have up to two active S3 keys at a time.
</Info>

### Creating S3 key 

To start the flow to create an S3 key, click the Create S3 Key button. In the new page, confirm your action by clicking Create S3 Key.

![Create S3 Key](/images/s3-bucket-configuration/s3_key_creation.png)

Sometimes (especially when you create your S3 key for the first time) AWS will take some time to setup your access. Please be patient and do not close or refresh the page you’re currently on.

Successful S3 key creation 

Once your S3 key was created, you MUST write down your secret key and store it in a safe place.

BSPK does not store keys. Once a key has been generated, we can't recover the secret.

If you lose the secret key, the only option is to delete the old S3 key and create a new one.

### Deleting S3 key 

From time to time, you may want to rotate your keys and delete your old S3 key.

<Info>
  AWS Security Best Practices recommend rotating (deleting the old S3 key and creating a new one) periodically, at least twice a year.
</Info>

To do this, click the **Delete** button corresponding to the existing S3 key.

After confirmation, the S3 key will be deleted.

### AWS Errors 

Sometimes there can be transition error communicating with AWS. If you see an error, `"Something went wrong. Please try again later"`, do not worry. Wait for a minute and try again.

If the error persists, please contact your local support.

### Working with S3 Buckets 

Once you have created your S3 keys, you are ready to upload files to your S3 bucket. There are many options available.

#### Programatic Integration 

AWS has a very detailed guide on how you can upload files using S3 Keys.

[Uploading objects - Amazon Simple Storage Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/upload-objects.html)

These can be done with:

- AWS SDK integration
  - .NET
  - Java
  - Javascript
  - Ruby
  - PHP
- REST API (Ex. Postman and many GUI clients for differents OSes)
- AWS CLI

<Note>
  To minimize security risks and follow best practices, S3 key are limited to file upload and listing in your company’s S3 bucket. You can’t download or delete files.
</Note>

<Info>
  Please use your company S3 bucket name in the examples below
</Info>

#### AWS CLI 

First install the AWS CLI. Please follow the instructions in the [official AWS guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

Once the AWS CLI is installed, please run the `aws configure` command. Provide **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** to the console input. Region name and output format should be entered as displayed below.

Please be mindful of trailing and leading spaces - they should not be present.

Once AWS CLI is configured, you can use it to upload and list with following commands.

**Listing your bucket files**

```bash
aws s3 ls s3://bspk-test-company-integration-dev2
```

**Uploading your files to S3 bucket**

```bash
aws s3 cp test-file.csv s3://bspk-test-company-integration-dev2
```
