title: Rate limiting
---

All API calls are limited to `30` requests every `10` seconds. Once this limit has been reached, calls will return and error with status code 429. This rate limit is evaluated on a rolling window basis.

API requests are limited to the amount specified in the returned `X-RateLimit-Limit` header (per 10 seconds). Exceeding that limit will cause BSPK to return an `HTTP 429` response. Check the `X-RateLimit-Limit` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` headers to see how many more requests you are allowed until throttling kicks in.

```console
$ curl -I --header "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
https://api.bspk.com/api/extraction/v1/appointments

> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> Date: Sat, 07 Aug 2021 00:17:40 GMT
> Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
> X-Ratelimit-Limit: 30
> X-Ratelimit-Remaining: 29
```

Whenever the rate limit is reached, in addition to the other headers you will also receive the `X-RateLimit-Reset` which you can use to smartly call our API again only after rate limit window is reseted.

You can use your desired programing language to convert the UTC epoch seconds to DateTime so that you can use it.
