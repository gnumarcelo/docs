The BSPK API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

To access BSPK's API a company's administrator must generate an `API Key` on the BSPK Admin portal and **provide a list of IP addresses** so that we allow these IP adresses access our API endpoints.

Please reach out to [bspk-support@bspk.com](mailto:bspk-support@bspk.com) in case you have any question related to BSPK API.

#### Current Supported APIs:


| API           | Base URL | Description / Main Usecase | 
| --------------| ---------| ---------------------------|
| <a href="/extraction-api">Extraction API</a> | `https://api.bspk.com/api/extraction/*` | Focused on providing *read* access to the data generated on BSPK's side so that you use it to fetch data and feed it into your system.  |
| <a href="/platform-api">Platform API</a> | `https://api.bspk.com/api/platform/*` |Focused on providing a way to easily integrate external systems with BSPK Platform via endpoints and webhook events.|

Once you are in possession of the `API Key` and have provided your IP address to our allowed list, then you can start using our API. We provide you both Swagger Documentation and a Postman Collection for each of our APIs so that you can easily start exploring it.

## Postman Collections
