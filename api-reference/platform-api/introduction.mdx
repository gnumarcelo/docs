Focused on providing a way to easily integrate external systems with BSPK’s platform via endpoints and webhook events, BSPK’s Platform API provides a RESTful interface with JSON-formatted responses to manage Webhooks and link External Entities with BSPK’s Entities. Although it is currently limited to link only Clients at the moment, more will come soon.

There are many use cases you can use our API for, one common use case is to update your ERP system with Client’s data generated at BSPK.

We are continuously working on expanding our API functionality, so stay tuned!
