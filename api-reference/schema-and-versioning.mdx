## Schema

All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from `https://api.bspk.com`. All data is sent as JSON.

```console
$ curl -I --header "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" https://api.bspk.com/api/extraction/v1/appointments

> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> Server: nginx
> Date: Sat, 07 Aug 2021 00:17:40 GMT
> Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
> X-Ratelimit-Limit: 30
> X-Ratelimit-Remaining: 1

> Etag: W/"0eb2bd3f90361ca510aad3a24c2063cf"
```

Blank fields are included as null instead of being omitted.

All timestamps return in ISO 8601 format:
```
YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
```

## Versioning

BSPK reserves the right to add more properties to objects, but will never change or remove them. Any breaking changes will result in a major API version update and will be comunicated previously.
