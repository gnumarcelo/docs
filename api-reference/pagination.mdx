title: Pagination

We basically expose the pagination information all via header attributes, as follows:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>key</th>
      <th>eg. value</th>
      <th>description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>X-Total-Count</td>
      <td>
        <code>123</code>
      </td>
      <td>Information about the total records the query will return in total (all pages)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Link</td>
      <td>
        <code>&lt;https://api.bspk.com/api/extraction/v1/emails.json?page=2&gt;; rel='next', &lt;https://api.bspk.com/api/extraction/v1/emails.json?page=18&gt;; rel='last'</code>
      </td>
      <td>Links for the last and next pages</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

For example, let's make a curl request to the messages API, to find out how many message we have for the client `CLI1`:

```console
$ curl -I "https://api.bspk.com/api/extraction/v1/messages?client_ids=CLI1"
```

The `-I` parameter indicates that we only care about the headers, not the actual content. In examining the result, you'll notice some information in the Link header that looks like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx
Date: Sat, 07 Aug 2021 22:34:11 GMT
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
X-Total-Count: 3000
Link: <https://api.bspk.com/api/extraction/v1/messages?client_ids=CLI1&page=2>; rel='next',
      <https://api.bspk.com/api/extraction/v1/messages?client_ids=CLI1&page=30>; rel='last'
```

Since by default, all paginated queries start at page `1`, `rel="last"` provides more information stating that the last page of results is on page `30`. Thus, we have `29` more pages of information about messages from client `CLI1` that we can consume.
