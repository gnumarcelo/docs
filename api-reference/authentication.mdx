title: Authentication
---

BSPK API uses a token based authentication which you have to include in the header of every request. Company admins can generate API keys and can have multiple valid tokens at the same time.

To generate an API token, in the BSPK Portal web app go to `API keys` menu and click the **CREATE A API KEY** button.

<Info>
  **Important**: Developers with BSPK API keys will be granted full access to the data in each endpoint. Access to this data is binary: everything or nothing.
</Info>

Requests that require authentication will return `403 Forbidden` in case of invalid credential or your IP address is not allowed not present in our allowed list.

The authorization header should be in the following format:

```console
$ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" https://api.bspk.com/api/extraction/v1/appointments
```


<Warning>
  Access to Extraction API is IP restricted. Please contact [bspk-support@bspk.com](mailto:bspk-support@bspk.com) to provide a list of IP addresses you want to allow or your requests will be denied.
