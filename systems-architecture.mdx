#### Example of a connector
The specific reference to Y2 is for illustration purpose, as it is a common POS solution. Integration and Extraction APIs can be used to interface with other non-transactional systems as needed. For example, client communication preferences can be kept up-to-date between BSPK and a 3rd party email marketing system.

### Connectors 

BSPK integrates with common retail POS management systems such as Cegid Y2 via connectors. With minimal effort, a connector can be customized to fit your specific needs and configuration. Alternatively, a company can choose to integrate via their standard cloud integration platforms (MuleSoft, Talend, Boomi, etc.) directly into the BSPK system, providing additional flexibility.
